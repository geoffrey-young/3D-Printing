# Macros for setting the status leds on the Voron StealthBurner toolhead (or for any neopixel-type leds).
#
# You will need to configure a neopixel (or other addressable led, such as dotstar). See
# https://www.klipper3d.org/Config_Reference.html#neopixel for configuration details.

# How to use all this stuff:
#
#     1.  Copy this .cfg file into your Klipper config directory and then add [include stealthburner_leds.cfg]
#         to the top of your printer.cfg in order for register the LEDs and macros with Klipper.
#     2.  Define your LEDs by editing [neopixel sb_leds] below and entering the data pin from your control board
#         as well as the color order.
#
#           Note: RGB and RGBW are different and must be defined explicitly.  RGB and RGBW are also not able to 
#                 be mix-and-matched in the same chain. A separate data line would be needed for proper functioning.
#
#                 RGBW LEDs will have a visible yellow-ish phosphor section to the chip.  If your LEDs do not have
#                 this yellow portion, you have RGB LEDs.
#
#     3.  Save your config and restart Klipper.
#
#           Note: We set RED and BLUE to 1.0 to make it easier for users and supporters to detect 
#                 misconfigurations or miswiring. The default color format is for Neopixels with a dedicated 
#                 white LED. On startup, all three SB LEDs should light up.
#
#                 If you get random colors across your LEDs, change the color_order to GRB and restart. Then
#                 omit the W for each suggested color_order in the next paragraph.
#
#                 If you get MAGENTA, your  color order is correct. If you get CYAN, you need to use RGBW. If
#                 you get YELLOW, you need to use BRGW (note that BRG is only supported in the latest Klipper
#                 version).
#
#     4.  Once you have confirmed that the LEDs are set up correctly, you must now decide where you want 
#         these macros called up...which means adding them to your existing gcode macros.  NOTHING will happen
#         unless you add the STATUS_????? macros to your existing gcode macros.  
#
#           Example: add STATUS_LEVELING to the beginning of your QGL gcode macro, and then add STATUS_READY 
#                    to the end of it to set the logo LED and nozzle LEDs back to the `ready` state.
#
#           Example: add STATUS_CLEANING to the beginning of your nozzle-cleaning macro, and then STATUS_READY
#                    to the end of it to return the LEDs back to `ready` state.
#
#     5.  Feel free to change colors of each macro, create new ones if you have a need to.  The macros provided below
#         are just an example of what is possible.  If you want to try some more complex animations, you will most
#         likely have to use WLED with Moonraker and a small micro-controller (please see the LED thread for help inside
#         of the stealthburner_beta channel on Discord).
